# random-quote-generator

This project is a demonstration of basic use of asynchronous requests with the JQuery ```$ajax()``` function

When 'Get Quote' is pressed, a request is sent to an API which generates a quote object. Information from the quote object is displayed on the page when it is received by the browser.

The 'loading' animation was created using CSS animation.
